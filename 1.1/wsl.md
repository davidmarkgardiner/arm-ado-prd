To ensure GitHub Copilot uses the WSL bash terminal instead of PowerShell, you'll need to configure your development environment properly. Here are the key steps:

## Set WSL as Your Default Terminal in VS Code

1. **Open VS Code settings** (Ctrl+,)
2. **Search for "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows"**
3. **Set it to "Git Bash" or "WSL"** depending on your preference
4. **Alternatively, you can add this to your settings.json:**
```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "Ubuntu" // or your WSL distro name
}
```

## Configure Your Workspace for WSL

1. **Open your project in WSL** by using the "Remote-WSL" extension
2. **Use the command palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select "Remote-WSL: New WSL Window"
3. **Navigate to your project folder** within the WSL environment

## Update Terminal Profile Settings

In your VS Code settings, ensure the WSL profile is properly configured:
```json
{
  "terminal.integrated.profiles.windows": {
    "Ubuntu": {
      "path": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\wsl.exe",
      "args": ["-d", "Ubuntu"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Key Points

- **Context matters**: Copilot generates suggestions based on your current environment and file types
- **File extensions**: Make sure you're working with appropriate file extensions (.sh, .bash, etc.)
- **Remote development**: Using the Remote-WSL extension ensures Copilot understands you're in a Linux environment
- **Project structure**: Having Linux-specific files and configurations helps Copilot provide more relevant bash suggestions

## Additional Tips

- Install the "Remote-WSL" extension if you haven't already
- Consider adding a `.vscode/settings.json` file to your project with WSL-specific configurations
- Use WSL-specific paths in your project files to give Copilot better context

Once configured this way, Copilot should provide bash/Linux-appropriate suggestions rather than PowerShell commands.
