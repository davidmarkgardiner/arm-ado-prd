# Epic 3: Staging Environment Migration

## Epic Overview
**Epic Goal**: Migrate staging environment with production-ready security
**Duration**: 4 weeks (Sprints 9-12)
**Story Points**: 200 points

- **Identity**: Workload identity with conditional access policies
- **Runtime Security**: Pod Security Standards (restricted), OPA Gatekeeper policies
- **Monitoring**: Security event correlation, threat detection, audit logging
- **Compliance**: SOC 2 Type II compliance validation, penetration testing

## Performance Validation
- **Load Testing**: Comprehensive load testing scenarios with production-equivalent traffic
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling validation under stress conditions
- **Performance**: Response time, throughput, and resource utilization benchmarking
- **Capacity Planning**: Resource requirement validation for production sizing

## Dependencies
- Epic 2 completion (Development environment operational)
- Security team approval for production-equivalent controls
- Performance testing tools and scenarios
- External security audit team availability

## Risks and Mitigation
- **High Risk**: Security compliance gaps discovered during audit
  - **Mitigation**: Early security review, incremental validation, expert consultation
- **High Risk**: Performance issues under production load
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, performance optimization, capacity planning
- **Medium Risk**: Disaster recovery procedures fail validation
  - **Mitigation**: Multiple test scenarios, procedure refinement, backup strategies

## Success Metrics
- **Security**: Zero high-severity vulnerabilities, 100% compliance with security policies
- **Performance**: ≥99.9% availability, response times ≤ production targets
- **Recovery**: RTO ≤ 4 hours, RPO ≤ 1 hour for disaster recovery
- **Load Testing**: Support 3x production traffic without degradation
- **Cost**: Maintain cost optimization targets from development migration
