## Migration Strategy
### Blue-Green Deployment Approach
1. **Blue Environment**: Current production ARM-based infrastructure
2. **Green Environment**: New ASO-managed production infrastructure
3. **Parallel Operation**: Both environments operational during migration
4. **Traffic Shifting**: Gradual traffic migration with monitoring and validation
5. **Cutover**: Complete traffic switch to green environment
6. **Decommissioning**: Safe shutdown of blue environment after validation

### Risk Mitigation
- **Zero-Downtime Requirement**: Blue-green deployment ensures continuous service
- **Rollback Capability**: Immediate traffic switch back to blue if issues detected
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of all systems during migration
- **Communication**: Stakeholder communication throughout migration process

## Dependencies

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Critical Risk**: Production downtime during migration
  - **Mitigation**: Blue-green deployment, comprehensive testing, immediate rollback capability
- **High Risk**: Application compatibility issues in production
  - **Mitigation**: Staging environment validation, gradual traffic shifting, monitoring
- **Medium Risk**: Performance degradation under production load
  - **Mitigation**: Load testing validation, performance monitoring, optimization procedures
