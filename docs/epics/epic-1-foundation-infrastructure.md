# Epic 1: Foundation Infrastructure

## Epic Overview
**Epic Goal**: Establish management cluster with ASO and GitOps capabilities
**Duration**: 4 weeks (Sprints 1-4)
**Story Points**: 200 points
**Team Focus**: Platform Team, Security Team, Network Team

## Epic Description
Deploy and configure the foundational infrastructure required for the ARM to Azure Service Operator migration. This epic establishes the management cluster that will orchestrate all infrastructure across multiple environments and subscriptions using Kubernetes-native tools.

## Business Value
- Enables centralized infrastructure management across multiple environments
- Establishes GitOps workflows for infrastructure as code
- Implements comprehensive security and monitoring baselines
- Provides foundation for subsequent migration phases

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Management cluster operational with 99.9% uptime target
- [ ] Azure Service Operator v2 successfully provisions test resources
- [ ] Flux v2 operational with automated reconciliation
- [ ] Cross-subscription RBAC functional across all target subscriptions
- [ ] Security policies enforced and auditing operational
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring and alerting functional

## Technical Architecture
- **Management Cluster**: Private AKS cluster with workload identity
- **Network**: Management VNet (10.250.0.0/16) with bastion access
- **Security**: Zero-trust architecture with comprehensive RBAC
- **GitOps**: Flux v2 with post-build variable substitution
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Azure Monitor integration

## Dependencies
- Azure subscription setup and access approvals
- Network architecture and IP allocation approval
- Security team RBAC design approval
- Git repository provisioning and access

## Risks and Mitigation
- **High Risk**: Cross-subscription RBAC complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing in development environment, phased approach
- **Medium Risk**: ASO v2 stability in production
  - **Mitigation**: Pilot testing, vendor support engagement
- **Medium Risk**: Network connectivity complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, monitoring, fallback procedures

## Definition of Done
- All management cluster components deployed and operational
- Cross-subscription resource provisioning validated
- GitOps workflow functional with automated reconciliation
- Security policies enforced and monitoring operational
- Performance targets met (20min cluster provisioning, <5min reconciliation)
- Comprehensive documentation and runbooks completed
- Team training completed on new procedures

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Management cluster passing all health checks
- [ ] ASO successfully provisions resources across all target subscriptions
- [ ] Flux successfully reconciles infrastructure changes within 5 minutes
- [ ] Security policies enforced with zero high-severity violations
- [ ] Monitoring captures all critical metrics with alerting functional
- [ ] Audit logging operational with proper log retention
- [ ] Cross-subscription permissions validated and documented
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet or exceed targets

## Next Epic
Upon completion, this epic enables **Epic 2: Development Environment Migration** where the foundation will be used to migrate the first production workload environment.
