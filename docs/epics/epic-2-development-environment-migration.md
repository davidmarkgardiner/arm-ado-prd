# Epic 2: Development Environment Migration

## Epic Overview
**Epic Goal**: Migrate development environment from ARM to ASO
**Duration**: 4 weeks (Sprints 5-8)
**Story Points**: 200 points
**Team Focus**: Platform Team, Development Teams, DevOps Team

## Epic Description
Execute the migration of the development environment from ARM template-based infrastructure to Azure Service Operator managed infrastructure. This epic validates the end-to-end GitOps workflow and establishes operational procedures for subsequent environments.

## Business Value
- Validates migration approach and procedures before production
- Enables development teams to experience and adapt to new workflows
- Establishes operational patterns for staging and production migrations
- Provides performance and cost optimization opportunities

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Development environment fully operational via ASO-managed infrastructure
- [ ] All development applications migrated and functional with zero data loss
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds previous ARM-based environment
- [ ] Development teams trained and productive on new GitOps workflows
- [ ] Cost optimization targets achieved (20% reduction)

## Technical Architecture
- **Target Cluster**: AKS with Node Auto Provisioning (NAP) enabled
- **Network**: Development VNet (10.240.0.0/16) with private cluster configuration
- **Security**: Production-equivalent security controls for validation
- **Migration Strategy**: Blue-green deployment pattern for zero-downtime transition
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability stack with cost optimization tracking

## Migration Approach
1. **Parallel Deployment**: Deploy new ASO-managed cluster alongside existing ARM cluster
2. **Application Migration**: Migrate applications using blue-green deployment pattern
3. **Traffic Switching**: Gradual traffic transition with monitoring and rollback capability
4. **Validation**: Comprehensive testing and performance validation
5. **Decommissioning**: Clean shutdown of legacy ARM infrastructure

## Dependencies
- Epic 1 completion (Management cluster operational)
- Development team availability for migration activities
- Application backup and data migration procedures
- DNS and networking changes approval

## Risks and Mitigation
- **High Risk**: Application compatibility issues during migration
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing in staging-like environment, rollback procedures
- **Medium Risk**: Performance degradation during migration
  - **Mitigation**: Performance monitoring, gradual traffic shifting, optimization procedures
- **Medium Risk**: Development team adaptation to new workflows
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive training program, documentation, support procedures

## Success Metrics
- **Performance**: Development environment performance ≥ baseline
- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime during migration period
- **Migration Time**: Complete migration within planned 4-week window
- **Cost**: 20% reduction in infrastructure costs
- **Team Productivity**: Development team velocity maintained or improved

## Definition of Done
- Development AKS cluster deployed and operational via ASO
- All development applications migrated with zero data loss
- Performance benchmarks meet or exceed ARM-based baseline
- Development teams trained and operational on GitOps workflows
- Monitoring and alerting operational for proactive issue detection
- Security validation completed with zero high-severity findings
- Cost optimization targets achieved and validated
- Migration procedures documented and validated for staging epic

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Development cluster provisioned via ASO with all required features
- [ ] Node Auto Provisioning functional and optimizing costs
- [ ] All applications operational with performance ≥ baseline
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration process
- [ ] Development teams productive on new GitOps workflows
- [ ] Monitoring captures all critical metrics and alerts appropriately
- [ ] Security controls equivalent to or better than previous environment
- [ ] Infrastructure costs reduced by ≥20% compared to ARM baseline
- [ ] Migration runbook validated and ready for staging environment
