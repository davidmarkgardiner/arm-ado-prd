## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
This story depends on completion of Epic 1 (Foundation phase):
- Management cluster must be operational with ASO and Flux
- Cross-subscription RBAC and networking must be established
- Monitoring and security baseline must be in place

### Current Development Environment Analysis
**Existing ARM Template Structure** [Source: architecture.md#current-arm-template-analysis]:
```json
{
  "current_dev_environment": {
    "subscription": "development-subscription-id",
    "resource_group": "dev-workloads-rg",
    "aks_cluster": {
      "name": "dev-workloads-aks",
      "version": "1.28.x",
      "node_provisioning": "manual",
      "network_plugin": "azure",
      "network_policy": "calico",
      "private_cluster": false,
      "workload_identity": false
    },
    "limitations": [
      "Static configuration requiring redeployment",
      "Manual node scaling",
      "Public endpoint exposure",
      "Limited GitOps integration"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Migration Strategy Architecture
**Blue-Green Migration Pattern** [Source: architecture.md#blue-green-migration-strategy]:
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Phase 1: Parallel Infrastructure"
        CurrentCluster[Current AKS Dev<br/>(Blue)]
        NewCluster[New ASO AKS Dev<br/>(Green)]
        LoadBalancer[Load Balancer]

        CurrentCluster -.-> LoadBalancer
        NewCluster -.-> LoadBalancer
    end

    subgraph "Phase 2: Traffic Switching"
        TrafficSplit[Traffic Split<br/>Blue: 100% → 0%<br/>Green: 0% → 100%]
        Monitoring[Migration Monitoring]
        Rollback[Rollback Capability]

        TrafficSplit -.-> Monitoring
        Monitoring -.-> Rollback
    end

    subgraph "Phase 3: Validation & Cleanup"
        Validation[Service Validation]
        Cleanup[Blue Infrastructure Cleanup]

        Validation --> Cleanup
    end
```

### Development Environment Inventory
**Application and Data Inventory**:
```yaml

  applications:
    web_applications:
      - name: "dev-frontend"
        replicas: 2
        persistent_storage: false
        external_dependencies: ["dev-backend-api"]

      - name: "dev-backend-api"
        replicas: 3
        persistent_storage: true
        volume_size: "10Gi"
        database_dependencies: ["dev-postgres"]

    databases:
      - name: "dev-postgres"
        type: "postgresql"

    monitoring:
      - name: "dev-prometheus"
        persistent_storage: true
        volume_size: "20Gi"

  network_configuration:
    vnet_cidr: "10.240.0.0/16"
    subnet_cidr: "10.240.1.0/24"

    load_balancer_type: "standard"

  security_configuration:
    network_policies: "basic"
    rbac_enabled: true
    pod_security_policies: "permissive"
```

### Backup and Restore Procedures
**Comprehensive Backup Strategy**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# dev-environment-backup.sh

echo "Starting development environment backup..."

# 1. Backup persistent volumes
kubectl get pv -o yaml > dev-persistent-volumes.yaml
for pv in $(kubectl get pv -o name); do
  echo "Backing up $pv..."
  # Create volume snapshots using Azure Disk Snapshot
  az snapshot create --resource-group MC_dev-workloads-rg_dev-workloads-aks_eastus \
    --source "$pv" \
    --name "dev-migration-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
done

# 2. Backup application configurations
kubectl get all,configmap,secret,ingress -o yaml --all-namespaces > dev-k8s-resources.yaml

# 3. Export ARM template configuration
az group export --name dev-workloads-rg > dev-arm-template.json

# 4. Backup application data
kubectl exec -n applications postgres-0 -- pg_dumpall > dev-postgres-backup.sql

# 5. Create cluster configuration backup
kubectl cluster-info dump --all-namespaces > dev-cluster-dump.yaml

echo "Development environment backup completed"
```

| **Application Compatibility** | Medium | Medium | Thorough testing, staging validation |
| **Network Connectivity** | Medium | Low | Parallel network setup, DNS planning |
| **Team Readiness** | Low | Medium | Training, documentation, support |
