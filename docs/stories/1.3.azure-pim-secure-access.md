# Story 1.3: Azure PIM Just-In-Time Secure Access

<!-- Powered by BMADâ„¢ Core -->

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Platform Engineer working in a banking environment,
**I want** to implement Azure PIM with tiered just-in-time access controls for the management cluster,
**so that** I can ensure banking-compliant security with segregation of duties, comprehensive auditing, and controlled break-glass procedures.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Azure PIM configured with tiered access roles for management cluster
2. Just-in-time activation with approval workflows implemented
3. Comprehensive audit logging integrated with central SIEM
4. Break-glass procedures documented and tested
5. Banking compliance controls validated
6. Network access remains private (no public endpoints)

## Dev Notes

### Security Architecture Design
**Tiered Access Control Model**:
- **Tier 1 (Monitor)**: 4-hour read-only access with self/manager approval
- **Tier 2 (Operator)**: 2-hour namespace-scoped access with manager + security approval
- **Tier 3 (Infrastructure)**: 1-hour cluster admin with senior + security + change approval
- **Tier 4 (Emergency)**: 30-minute break-glass with post-incident review

**Banking Compliance Features**:
- Just-in-time access with time-bound sessions
- Multi-stage approval workflows
- Comprehensive audit trails with SIEM integration
- Segregation of duties enforcement
- Break-glass with oversight controls
- Non-repudiation through detailed logging

### Previous Story Dependencies
This story replaces Story 1.2 (Azure Bastion) with a more banking-appropriate security model. It depends on:
- Story 1.1 (Management Cluster Deployment) completion
- Management cluster and VNet operational
- Azure AD integration configured
- Central SIEM system available

### Data Models
**Access Control Tiers** [Source: security-analysis.md]:
```yaml
access_tiers:
  monitor:
    duration: "4h"
    approval: ["self", "manager"]
    permissions: ["get", "list", "describe", "logs"]
    scope: "cluster-wide"
  operator:
    duration: "2h"
    approval: ["manager", "security"]
    permissions: ["get", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
    scope: "namespace-scoped"
  infrastructure:
    duration: "1h"
    approval: ["senior", "security", "change-mgmt"]
    permissions: ["*"]
    scope: "cluster-admin"
  emergency:
    duration: "30m"
    approval: ["post-incident-review"]
    permissions: ["cluster-admin"]
    scope: "break-glass"
```

**Network Configuration** [Source: architecture.md#network-architecture]:
- Management VNet CIDR: 10.250.0.0/16
- Management Cluster Subnet: 10.250.2.0/24
- Private cluster configuration with no public endpoints
- Network access through Azure Private Link

### API Specifications
**Azure PIM Configuration** [Source: banking-compliance.md]:
- PIM-eligible assignments for management cluster roles
- Just-in-time activation with approval workflows

**Kubernetes RBAC Roles** [Source: security-requirements.md]:
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole

  name: pim-monitor-role
rules:
- apiGroups: ["*"]
  resources: ["*"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods/log"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
```

### Component Specifications
**Azure PIM Service** [Source: architecture.md#security-architecture]:
