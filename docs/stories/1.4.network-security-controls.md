### Previous Story Dependencies
This story builds on:
- Story 1.1 (Management Cluster Deployment): Provides the cluster and network foundation
- Story 1.3 (Cross-Subscription RBAC): Provides permissions for cross-subscription network resources

### Network Architecture
**Network Segmentation Strategy** [Source: architecture.md#network-segmentation-strategy]:
```yaml
network_segmentation:
  management_tier:
    vnet_cidr: "10.250.0.0/16"
    subnets:
      bastion: "10.250.1.0/24"
      management_cluster: "10.250.2.0/24"
      monitoring: "10.250.3.0/24"

  network_tier:
    vnet_cidr: "10.0.0.0/16"
    subnets:
      firewall: "10.0.1.0/24"
      dns: "10.0.2.0/24"
      gateway: "10.0.3.0/24"
```

**Network Topology** [Source: architecture.md#target-network-topology]:
- Management VNet (10.250.0.0/16) with bastion and cluster subnets
- Hub VNet (10.0.0.0/16) for shared network services
- Azure Firewall for centralized egress control
- Private DNS zones for internal service discovery

### Security Controls
**Azure Firewall Rules** [Source: architecture.md#network-security-controls]:
```yaml
azure_firewall_rules:
  network_rules:
    management_cluster_outbound:
      priority: 100
      action: "Allow"
      source: "10.250.2.0/24"
      destination: "10.240.0.0/16,10.241.0.0/16,10.242.0.0/16"
      ports: ["443", "22"]
      protocol: "TCP"

    aks_to_azure_services:
      priority: 200
      action: "Allow"
      source: "*"
      destination: "AzureCloud"
      ports: ["443"]
      protocol: "TCP"

  application_rules:
    container_registry:
      priority: 100
      source: "*"
      target_fqdns: ["*.azurecr.io", "mcr.microsoft.com"]
      protocol: "HTTPS"

    package_managers:
      priority: 200
      source: "*"
      target_fqdns: ["*.ubuntu.com", "security.ubuntu.com"]
      protocol: "HTTPS"
```

**NSG Security Rules**:
- Inbound: Only bastion subnet access (10.250.1.0/24) to cluster subnet
- Outbound: HTTPS to Azure services, deny all other traffic
- Logging: Enable NSG flow logs for security monitoring

### Zero-Trust Implementation
**Network Security Model** [Source: architecture.md#zero-trust-security-model]:
- Private AKS clusters with no public endpoints
- Azure Bastion for secure administrative access
- Network Security Groups with explicit allow rules
- Azure Firewall for application-layer filtering
- Private DNS zones for internal name resolution

**Defense in Depth Strategy**:
1. Network layer: NSGs, Azure Firewall, private endpoints
2. Transport layer: TLS encryption for all communications
3. Application layer: Network policies, service mesh security
4. Data layer: Encryption at rest and in transit

### DNS Configuration
**Private DNS Architecture**:
- privatelink.{region}.azmk8s.io for AKS API server
- privatelink.azurecr.io for container registry
- Custom zones for internal service discovery
- Conditional forwarding for hybrid scenarios

### File Locations
**Network Configuration Structure** [Source: folder-structure.md]:
- Network resources managed from management cluster via ASO
- Configuration stored in `eng/azureserviceoperator/managementcluster/configmap/`
- Network-specific manifests in dedicated network subscription deployment

### Performance Requirements
**Network Performance Targets** [Source: architecture.md#technical-constraints]:
- Inter-VNet latency < 10ms within region
- Firewall throughput supporting concurrent cluster operations
- DNS resolution time < 100ms for internal queries
- Network monitoring with real-time alerting

## Testing

### Network Security Validation
- NSG rule effectiveness testing
- Firewall rule validation and bypass testing
- Private DNS resolution verification
- Network connectivity testing between subnets
- Traffic flow analysis and anomaly detection

### Security Penetration Testing
- External network access attempt testing
- Internal network lateral movement testing
- DNS poisoning and manipulation attempts
- Firewall rule bypass testing

### Performance Testing
- Network latency measurement across VNet peers
- Firewall throughput testing under load
- DNS resolution performance validation
- Network monitoring system validation
