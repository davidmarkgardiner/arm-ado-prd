# Story 1.2: Azure Bastion Secure Access

<!-- Powered by BMADâ„¢ Core -->

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Platform Engineer,
**I want** to setup Azure Bastion for secure cluster access,
**so that** I can access the private management cluster securely.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Azure Bastion deployed in management VNet
2. Bastion subnet configured with proper NSG rules
3. SSH access to cluster nodes validated
4. kubectl access through bastion validated
5. Multi-factor authentication required

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create bastion subnet (10.250.1.0/24) (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create Bastion subnet with proper addressing
  - [ ] Configure Network Security Group rules for bastion
  - [ ] Validate subnet configuration and routing
- [ ] Deploy Azure Bastion service (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Deploy Azure Bastion in management VNet
  - [ ] Configure Bastion service parameters
  - [ ] Validate Bastion service operational status
- [ ] Configure Network Security Group rules (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Define minimal required access rules
  - [ ] Implement least privilege network access
  - [ ] Test NSG rule effectiveness
- [ ] Test SSH connectivity to cluster nodes (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Validate SSH access through Bastion to AKS nodes
  - [ ] Test administrative access patterns
  - [ ] Document SSH access procedures
- [ ] Validate kubectl access patterns (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Test kubectl connectivity through Bastion
  - [ ] Validate Kubernetes API access
  - [ ] Test cluster administrative operations
- [ ] Document access procedures (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Create secure access documentation
  - [ ] Document MFA requirements
  - [ ] Create troubleshooting guides

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story depends on Story 1.1 (Management Cluster Deployment) being completed. The management cluster and VNet must be operational before Bastion deployment.

### Data Models
**Network Configuration** [Source: architecture.md#network-architecture]:
- Management VNet CIDR: 10.250.0.0/16
- Bastion Subnet: 10.250.1.0/24
- Management Cluster Subnet: 10.250.2.0/24
- Private cluster configuration with no public endpoints

**Security Controls** [Source: architecture.md#security-architecture]:
- Network Security Groups with minimal required access
- Multi-factor authentication requirements
- Bastion host for secure access to private clusters

### API Specifications
**Azure Bastion Configuration** [Source: architecture.md#network-architecture]:
- Bastion subnet must be named "AzureBastionSubnet"
- Minimum subnet size /26 required for Azure Bastion
- NSG rules for HTTPS (443) and SSH (22) access

### Component Specifications
**Azure Bastion Service** [Source: architecture.md#target-network-topology]:
- Deployed in management subscription
- Connected to management VNet
- Provides secure RDP/SSH connectivity without public IPs
- Integrated with Azure AD for authentication

**Network Security Configuration** [Source: architecture.md#network-security-controls]:
```yaml
azure_firewall_rules:
  network_rules:
    management_cluster_outbound:
      priority: 100
      action: "Allow"
      source: "10.250.2.0/24"  # Management cluster
      destination: "10.240.0.0/16,10.241.0.0/16,10.242.0.0/16"
      ports: ["443", "22"]
      protocol: "TCP"
```

### File Locations
**Expected Project Structure** [Source: folder-structure.md]:
- Bastion configuration should be placed in: `eng/azureserviceoperator/managementcluster/`
- Network Security Group rules in NSG subdirectory
- Bastion service configuration in network infrastructure section

**Current Structure Misalignment**: The current directory structure under `eng/azureserviceoperator-flux/` doesn't align with the expected structure for management cluster components.

### Testing Requirements
**Infrastructure Testing** [Source: scrum-tickets-breakdown.md]:
- SSH access validation to cluster nodes
- kubectl access validation through bastion
- Network connectivity testing
- Security rule effectiveness validation
- Multi-factor authentication testing

### Technical Constraints
**Security Requirements** [Source: prd.md#security-requirements]:
- Zero-trust network architecture implementation
- Private clusters with no public API endpoints
- Comprehensive network security controls
- Multi-factor authentication for administrative operations

**Network Requirements** [Source: architecture.md#network-segmentation-strategy]:
- Bastion subnet isolation with proper NSG rules
- Least privilege network access principles
- Secure access patterns for cluster administration

### Project Structure Notes
**Structure Alignment Issue**: The current directory structure under `eng/azureserviceoperator-flux/` doesn't align with the expected structure in `docs/folder-structure.md` which shows `eng/azureserviceoperator/managementcluster/`. Network components should be organized under the management cluster structure.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Infrastructure Validation Testing**:
- Bastion service deployment validation
- Network connectivity testing through bastion
- SSH and kubectl access pattern validation
- Security rule effectiveness testing
- Multi-factor authentication flow testing

**Acceptance Testing**:
- Administrative access workflow validation
- Security compliance testing
- Performance and latency testing for remote access
