- **Management**: Individual cluster management per environment
- **Deployment**: Manual or CI/CD pipeline-driven ARM deployments
- **GitOps**: Limited or no GitOps implementation

### Target State
- **Infrastructure**: Azure Service Operator (ASO) v2 with Kubernetes-native resource management
- **Management**: Single management cluster controlling all environment clusters
- **Deployment**: GitOps-driven infrastructure and application deployment via Flux
- **Security**: Enhanced RBAC, network isolation, and comprehensive auditing
